Now we’re ready to create an “About me” page.

To create this page, you'll be adding the following 7 HTML tags which we discussed in this lesson:

<h1> - A first level heading tag. Normally there’s only one of these on a page, and it’s used to indicate the most important header.
  
<h2> - A second level heading tag. This is used for headers that are less important than <h1>. HTML gives us <h1> to <h6>. From <h2> on, it’s fine to use more than one on a page. Note that these heading tags help Google’s web crawlers understand what a page is about, and therefore are crucial for SEO. They also set default styling for any text they wrap (so an H1, for instance, will have bigger, bolder font than a paragraph, by default in all modern browsers).
  
<p> - The paragraph tag, which you’ll be shocked to learn is used to indicate that a grouping of text is a paragraph.
  
<ul> - The unordered list tag is used in conjunction with the <li> tag to represent un-numbered, bulleted lists of items.
<li> - Used to indicate a list item in a <ul>.
  
<a> - The anchor tag, which is used to link to another part of the page, or another page entirely.
  
<div> - The div tag, which is a generic container element, used to group together content.
